- 👋 Hi, I’m Filipe Gonçalves
- 👀 I’m interested in tech in general, especially in computers...let's say i'm kinda of a computer geek.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the full-stack web developer in The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people that know more than me and to expand my programing knowdledge.
- I'm currently working as a cook but my real passion is the tech industry and being around smart people and around computers. I hope that one day I will be doing something cool and be proud of what I've accomplished so far.
